= netview

Netview is a enumeration tool. It uses (with the -d) the current domain or a
specified domain (with the -d domain) to enumerate hosts. You can also use
the -f if you wish to specify a file with a list of hosts instead.

Once a list is gathered, netview check each for the following
+ IP addresses
+ Shares
+ Sessions (users connected to the machine from a remote source)
+ and Logged on users

Optionally all output can be redirected to a file with the '-o' argument.
